3.3.2 - January 16, 2018

* Fix Edit-File doesn't respect TextEditor property [#48](https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx/issues/48)

3.3.1 - October 12, 2017

* Fix Import-VisualStudioVars - Select-VSSetupInstance ignores VS 2017 Build Tools by default [#36](https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx/issues/36)
# Fix Import-VisualStudioVars - VS 2015 Build Tools don't have VsDevCmd.bat [#37](https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx/issues/37)
# Fix Import-VisualStudioVars fails when workload for VC isn't installed [#41](https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx/issues/41)

3.3.0 - September 5, 2017

* Fix issues with CD functionality not working on PowerShell Core.

* Updated Import-VisualStudioVars to support Visual Studio 2017.

3.2.2 - June 25, 2016

* Added better support for VS 2015 to Import-VisualStudioVars
  If you do not specify an architecture than VsDevCmd.bat is called
  otherwise vcvarsall.bat with the specified architecture is called.
  This function will now output messages output the batch file.  This
  is useful if you specify an architecture, say ARM, which you haven't
  installed support for.  You will now see that message from the batch
  file. Also added support for VS '15' using version number '150'.

* Use Unicode chars for Show-Tree for all code pages.  User can always
  fall back to using ASCII chars with -UseAsciiLineArt

* Updated aliases to prefix all associated commands with the PSCX module
  prefix.

* PSCX has moved to GitHub for further development:
  https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx

3.2.1 - July 29, 2015

* Updated to support PowerShell 5.0.

* Fixed bug in Get-Parameter related to getting dynamic parameter info.

* Updated Expand-Archive to output DirectoryInfo and FileInfo objects
  for the extracted directories and files when using -PassThru.

* Updated Get-TypeName to normally write the typename to the standard
  output stream.  However, if -PassThru is specified the object input
  to the command is output and the typename is written directly to the
  host UI.  This allows you to insert Get-TypeName -PassThru into the
  pipeline to observe which object types a flowing in the pipeline.


3.2.0 - October 23, 2014

* New Edit-File cmdlet that edits a file in-place using regular expressions
  and corresponding replacement strings.  The cmdlet attempts to determine
  the original encoding of the file and preserve that encoding.

* Fixed issue with the nested FileSystem module.  It's format data had to be
  updated to handle wider column output from Get-ChildItem now that WMF 5.0
  supports creating symbolic links, hard links, etc.

* Import-VisualStudioVars has been updated to handle VS 14 CTP by allowing you
  to specify version number 140. This should work with future versions of VS.

* The [hex] accelerator type was added in a previous release but was not
  added to PowerShell's type accelerators.  The accelerator is now loaded
  by the Pscx.Utility nested module.  You can now convert a decimal number
  to hex easily e.g. [hex]32 gives 0x20.

* Read-Archive has been changed to output individual ArchiveEntry objects
  instead of a single collection object.  This allows you to filter which
  items are extracted e.g.:

  Read-Archive foo.zip | Where Name -match \.txt | Expand-Archive -Out c:\temp

* Expand-Archive now implements the PassThru parameter allowing functionality
  such as:

  Expand-Archive foo.zip -Output c:\temp -PassThru | Move-Item -Dest c:\done

* Fixed documentation bug with Set-LocationEx. CD_EchoNewLocation was
  incorrectly specified as CD/EchoNewLocation.

* Changed the default value of CD_EchoNewLocation to False as the use of
  Write-Host to display the new CD location offends some folks.  You can
  turn it back by putting this in your profile (or set the value in your
  Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1 file):

  $Pscx:Preferences.CD_EchoNewLocation = $true

* Fixed issue 35430 - Invoke-BatchFile messes up encoding on non-English
  systems.

* Fixed issue 355537 - Default format information missing for
  Pscx.Commands.Modules.Utility.ExecutionTimeInfo.

* Issues 35314 and 35256 indicate some bugs with the Get-Help proxy
  command.  For now, we will not automticallly load this nested module.
  You can enable if you want by editing the Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1
  file and setting ModulesToImport -> GetHelp to $true.


3.1.0 - October 18, 2013

* PowerShell version checking bug fixed with WMI nested module.
* Import-VisualStudioVars updated to add VS2013 support.
* Get-Parameter updated to version 2.8 from PoshCode.org.
* Get-FileTail updated to open file FileShare.Delete perm to allow the file
*     to be deleted while being tailed.
* Invoke-Ternary / Invoke-NullCoalescing fixed to be able to access variables
*     in intermediate scopes.
* New-Junction/Symlink/Hardlink - moved PSPath parameter alias from
*     LiteralPath parameter to TargetPath parameter.  Path passed to
*     LiteralPath can't exist so makes more sense for pipeline binding
*     DirectoryInfo objects to TargetPath.  You can now do
*     Get-Item .\foodir | New-Junction foodirJunction.
* Updated DigiCert digital certificates used for script and MSI signing.

The primary purpose of the Pscx 3.1 release is to fully support Windows
PowerShell V3 and V4.  This version of Pscx is compiled against .NET 4.0 and
takes advantage of PowerShell V3 specific features.  This version of
Pscx WILL NOT RUN on PowerShell V2.

If you need Pscx support for PowerShell V2, please download the latest
Pscx 2.1 version from http://pscx.codeplex.com.

If you need support for Windows PowerShell 1.0, you can still download the
Pscx 1.2 release.

WINDOWS INSTALLER

While xcopy deployment works great for some folks, other prefer the
convenience of a traditional Windows Installer.  Furthermore, xcopy
ZIP packages downloaded from the PSCX CodePlex site have proven
troublesome because many users forget to unblock the ZIP file before
extracting the contents.

Pscx 3.1 is now provided in an Authenticode signed MSI file.
Note: the WIX-based installer prepends the Pscx installation dir to the
PSModulePath environment variable. This is required so that you can specify
just the module name 'Pscx' when doing an Import-Module instead of having
to specify a full path to the Pscx.psd1 file.  However, the WIX-based installer
isn't always successful in propagating the environment variable change.  In
this case, you can reboot the PC or load Pscx by the full path until your
next reboot.

CODE SIGNED SCRIPTS

All of the Pscx scripts including *.ps1, *.psm1 and *.ps1xml files have been
code signed for both the 2.1 and 3.1 releases.  This means that you will be
able to run Pscx in a PowerShell session where ExecutionPolicy is set to
AllSigned.  You will be prompted to confirm if you want to run code from
the untrusted publisher 6L6 Software LLC.  If you answer 'A' to always
run code from this publisher, you will not get prompted again for the
execution of Pscx scripts.

UPGRADING FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF PSCX

Pscx 3.1 does not automatically upgrade Pscx 2.1.  In fact, these two versions
of Pscx can live side-by-side.  NOTE: If you install Pscx 2.1 and 3.1 side-by-side,
you will have to use the -RequiredVersion parameter on Import-Module in order to
load Pscx 3.1.  By default, PowerShell searches modules in the order specified by
the environment variable PSModuleLoadPath.  PowerShell automatically prepends the
user's $home\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules dir to this path so PowerShell
will load Pscx 2.1, assuming you extracted it to your user Modules folder.  In
order to load Pscx 3.1 execute:

C:\PS> Import-Module Pscx -RequiredVersion 3.0.0.0

IMPORTING THE PSCX MODULE

Importing the Pscx module is very easy.  Just execute:

C:\PS> Import-Module Pscx

If you want to import Pscx in your profile, all you have to do is add the
command above to your profile.  Pscx can be customized in terms of
preference variables and what nested modules are automatically loaded.  In the
root dir of the Pscx module there is a file named Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1.
It shows the default values for the preference variable and which nested
modules are loaded by default.  If you want to change any of these, copy this
file to your WindowsPowerShell dir or your home dir, edit it and then pass
the path to this modified Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1 file to Import-Module e.g.:

C:\PS> Import-Module Pscx -arg ~\Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1

Pscx will now be imported with your preferences.

MISC UPDATES:

    Accelerators
        Pscx adds two new accelarators [wmidatetime] and [wmitimespan] which
        can be used to convert .NET DateTime and TimeSpan values into their
        WMI equivalents e.g.:

        C:\PS> [wmidatetime](get-date)
        20100411113710.551365-360

        C:\PS> [wmitimespan]((get-date) - (get-date).AddHours(-1))
        00000000010000.000000:000

        Note that converting from a WMI datetime or WMI timespan to the .NET
        equivalent can be accomplished by simply type casting e.g.:

        C:\PS> [datetime]'20100409131034.881722-360'
        Friday, April 09, 2010 1:10:34 PM

        You can also use [accelerators] as a shortcut to find all the
        accelerators available in PowerShell e.g.:

        C:\PS> [accelerators]::get

        Key                    Value
        ---                    -----
        int                    System.Int32
        long                   System.Int64
        string                 System.String
        char                   System.Char
        bool                   System.Boolean
        byte                   System.Byte
        double                 System.Double
        ...
        wmidatetime            Pscx.TypeAccelerators.WmiDateTime
        wmitimespan            Pscx.TypeAccelerators.WmiTimeSpan
