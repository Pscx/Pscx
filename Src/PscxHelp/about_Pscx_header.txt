    PowerShell Community Extensions (version <VERSION_NUMBER>)

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the Windows PowerShell Community Extensions (PSCX) module and 
    how to use the contained cmdlets and functions.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    PowerShell Community Extensions is a PowerShell module that provides a
    number of widely useful cmdlets.  PSCX is not affiliated with Microsoft 
    or the Windows PowerShell team at Microsoft.  We are a few (at the moment)
    passionate PowerShell users who wanted more cmdlets than Microsoft was 
    able to deliver in v1 and v2.  So we have taken it upon ourselves to
    create some of those cmdlets and make them available to the community.
        
POWERSHELL COMPATIBILITY
    PSCX 3.x is compiled against .NET 4 and consequently works only in 
    Windows PowerShell 3.0 and above. If you need Windows PowerShell 2.0 
    support, download PSCX 2.1.  If you need Windows PowerShell 1.0 support, 
    download PSCX 1.2.
    
PREFERENCE VARIABLES
    Previous versions of PSCX used global variables to store preference 
    information and variables created by PSCX functions.  Those have been 
    moved to the PSCX settings provider.  PSCX will no longer create any 
    variables in your global variable scope.  All PSCX preference settings 
    are now specified using the Pscx.UserPreferencs.ps1 file.  The file is 
    located in the root of the PSCX module folder.  Its default values 
    indicate the defaults used if no preference file is specified during 
    import of the PSCX module.  If you want to change any of the defaults, 
    then copy this file to your home dir, edit it and then import PSCX using 
    the -ArgumentList to specify the path to your updated 
    Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1 file e.g.:
    
    Import-Module Pscx -arg ~\Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1
    
    The preference variables and default values are:
    
    ShowModuleLoadDetails = $false # Display module load details during 
                                   # Import-Module.
    
    CD_GetChildItem = $false       # Display the contents of new provider 
                                   # location after using cd (Set-LocationEx).
                                   # Mutually exclusive with 
                                   # CD_EchoNewLocation.
                                   
    CD_EchoNewLocation = $false    # Display new provider location after using 
                                   # cd (Set-LocationEx).
                                   # Mutually exclusive with CD_GetChildItem.
    
    TextEditor = 'Notepad.exe'     # Default text editor used by the Edit-File
                                   # function.
    
    PromptTheme = 'Modern'         # Prompt string and window title updates.  
                                   # To enable, first set the ModulesToImport 
                                   # setting for Prompt below to $true.
                                   # Then set this value to one of: 'Modern', 
                                   # 'WinXP' or 'Jachym'.
    
    PageHelpUsingLess = $true      # Pscx replaces PowerShell's More function.

                                   # less.exe is used to page items piped to 
                                   # the More function. Less.exe is powerful 
                                   # paging app that allows advanced 
                                   # navigation and search. Press 'h' to

                                   # exit less.exe. Set this setting to $false
                                   # to use more.com for paging.
                                   
    SmtpFrom = $null               # These settings are used by the PSCX

                                   # specified port 25 is used.
