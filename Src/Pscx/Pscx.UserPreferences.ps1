# Any value not specified will be retrieved from the default preferences built

# If you have a sufficiently large number of altered preferences, copy this file,
# modify it and pass the path to your preferences file to Import-Module e.g.:
#
#     Import-Module Pscx -arg "$(Split-Path $profile -parent)\Pscx.UserPreferences.ps1"
