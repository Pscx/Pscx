What's New in PSCX 3.2.2
June 25, 2016

* Added better support for VS 2015 to Import-VisualStudioVars
  If you do not specify an architecture than VsDevCmd.bat is called
  otherwise vcvarsall.bat with the specified architecture is called.
  This function will now output messages output the batch file.  This
  is useful if you specify an architecture, say ARM, which you haven't
  installed support for.  You will now see that message from the batch
  file. Also added support for VS '15' using version number '150'.

* Use Unicode chars for Show-Tree for all code pages.  User can always
  fall back to using ASCII chars with -UseAsciiLineArt

* Updated aliases to prefix all associated commands with the PSCX module
  prefix.

* PSCX has moved to GitHub for further development:
